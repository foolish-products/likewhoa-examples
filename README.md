# What?!
Hi there!  

Welcome to this repo.  It contains the example code needed to start playing with the first edition Whoa Boards (check out [whoaboard.com](http://whoaboard.com) for more information!).

This repo contains examples for use with first edition whoa boards.

# How do I use this?  

Step 1: Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (version 1.6 or later)

Step 2: Press the green "clone or download" button to download the files here to your computer, and unzip the directory!

Step 3: Navigate to your Arduino "Sketchbook" (It defaults to a folder called Arduino in your documents folder on mac and windows)

Step 4: Copy and paste the folders here to this directory!

Windows users: Go into the windows folder, and install foolish_drivers.exe.  The source for this binary is avalible [here](https://github.com/foolish-products/foolish_products_windows_drivers).

Step 5: Open your Arduino IDE, if you look at the Tools menu, you should now be able to select the Whoa Board now!  

# How do I get started? 

If you have a board on hand, plug it into a USB slot on your computer.  If you open the Arduino IDE, and look at Tools>Port, one of the ports should say Whoa Board!  

If it doesn't try unplugging and replugging it into your USB slot and reopening the menu.  Also try pressing the reset button on the board. 

The code is still evolving fairly rapidly, but we'll do our best to document things a bit here later.
